1. [I Hate RegEx](https://ihateregex.io/)

Regex can be annoying sometimes, and every developer might relate to
that. So here's a website that is technically a cheat sheet for regex
string for common uses. Seriously, though, need a regex string for email
verification? Phone number verification? To verify whether the input is
an IP address? This website has it all!

2. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Seriously, it isn't that hard. Just take a look at this beautifully
written documentation, and you'll be a markdown pro in no time!
Honestly, i might've overexaggerated that previous sentence. However,
markdownguide might be the best markdown documentation you'll ever get
from the internet.

Maybe one day you don't want a regex cheatsheet, instead you want to
study it. But sometimes, it's hard to visualize what your RegEx is going
to capture. This website visualizes what your RegEx string is going to
capture. You can even input your own text for the RegEx to capture.
